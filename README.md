# cluster_reader
This is the start to the cluster reader service that will serve up cluster info in JSON via API endpoints.



### ToDo
* Update regex to include ? where errors can happen

* Break up all the nesting

* make functions more consise

* remove async from processor functions, only external calls

* Break apart single usecase to match api calls

* Create error types
